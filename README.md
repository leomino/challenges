# challenges
My random list of solutions for various coding challenges I solved for fun.

**Foobar** was my favorite challenge because the problems were truly hard and 
required mathematical thinking and knowledge. Finding out about those mathematical 
concepts and understand them was necessary to solve the problem. As I love math 
and riddles, that was something really fun to me.
